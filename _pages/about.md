I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at [Tsinghua-Berkey Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/english/) of [Tsinghua Unviversity](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Wenbo Ding](https://ssr-group.net). I originally joined TBSI as a master’s student and, after three years of research (2021-2024), transitioned to the Ph.D. track. I received the B.S. degree in communication engineering in [Chien-Shiung Wu College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/main.psp) from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm), Nanjing, China, in 2021. 

My research interest includes Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent System and Large Models. My current work focuses on advanced topics in reinforcement learning, decision systems, and complex adaptive systems, with an emphasis on applications that bridge theory and practice.

I’m passionate about solving real-world challenges through interdisciplinary research, and my academic journey has been shaped by a desire to push the boundaries of intelligent systems. Outside of my core research, I have a growing interest in fostering collaboration across fields to address high-dimensional problems and system-level optimization.

Feel free to explore my work, and I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers and collaborators!
