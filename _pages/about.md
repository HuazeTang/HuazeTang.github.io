I am a fourth year PhD student at [Tsinghua-Berkey Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/english/) of [Tsinghua Unviversity](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Wenbo Ding](https://ssr-group.net). I originally joined TBSI as a master’s student and, after three years of research (2021-2024), transitioned to the Ph.D. track. I received the B.S. degree in communication engineering in [Chien-Shiung Wu College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/main.psp) from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm), Nanjing, China, in 2021. 

My research interest includes Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent System and Large Models. My current work focuses on advanced topics in reinforcement learning, decision systems, and complex adaptive systems, with an emphasis on applications that bridge theory and practice.

I’m passionate about solving real-world challenges through interdisciplinary research, and my academic journey has been shaped by a desire to push the boundaries of intelligent systems. Outside of my core research, I have a growing interest in fostering collaboration across fields to address high-dimensional problems and system-level optimization.

Feel free to explore my work, and I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers and collaborators!

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
